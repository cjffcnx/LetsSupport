      <h2>What is Emotional Resilience?</h2>
      <p>Emotional resilience is the ability to adapt and bounce back when faced with adversity, trauma, or significant stress. It's not about avoiding difficulties, but rather developing the strength to recover from them.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Components of Resilience</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Understanding your emotions and triggers</li>
        <li><strong>Positive relationships:</strong> Building strong support networks</li>
        <li><strong>Self-care:</strong> Taking care of your physical and mental health</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Having clear goals and meaning in life</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Building Your Resilience</h3>
      <p>Resilience can be developed over time through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practicing gratitude daily</li>
        <li>Maintaining connections with supportive people</li>
        <li>Accepting that change is part of life</li>
        <li>Taking decisive actions rather than avoiding problems</li>
        <li>Looking for opportunities for self-discovery</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Remember: resilient people still experience stress and emotional pain, but they've developed healthy coping mechanisms to work through challenges.</p>
