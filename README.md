## 💜 What is Mind Matters?

Lets Support is a simple, friendly web app built to support mental well‑being through learning, reflection, and gentle habit building.  

The app is built with React and focuses on approachable content, interactive learning, and personal reflection.  

Key features:

- **8 short topic modules** covering resilience, self‑awareness, mindfulness, coping strategies, empathy, work‑life balance, gratitude, and leadership.  

- **Interactive quizzes** to reinforce learning and help you reflect.  

- **Private reflection journals** so users can capture their thoughts and progress.  

- **Progress tracking** to celebrate small wins.  

- **Responsive, accessible design** that works across devices.

This is intended to be a safe, non‑clinical space for learning and self‑reflection, not a substitute for professional help.
